title: About me 
---

Hello! My name is Jamie and I am a math major at UC Berkeley. I have several different interests, including math (currently especially interested in abstract algebra), biology (mainly genetics, computational biology/biomathematics and neurodegenerative disorders), and a newfound interest for calligraphy and literature. Feel free to email me at jamie@theeyrie.co.uk if you want to talk!
