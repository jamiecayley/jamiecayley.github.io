Welcome to the 11th post on my abstract algebra series. Today Iâ€™ll cover the conjugation action, the class equation and Cauchy's theorem.

The conjugation action was briefly covered on the previous post, namely it is an action of G on itself defined by $$g*a = gag^{-1}$$. The prbots of this action are called the conjugacy classes and if g and h are the same conjugacy class, we say g and h are conjugated.

Examples: $$\{1\}$$ is always a conjugacy class. If G is abelian, every conjugacy class is a singleton (more generally, the conjugacy class of a is a singleton if and only if $$a \in Z(G)$$. In $$D_8$$ the conjugacy classes are $$\{1\}, \{r, r^3\}, \{r^2\}, \{s, r^2s\}, \{rs, r^3s\}$$. In $$S_3 : \{1\}, \{(1 2 3), (1 3 2)\}, \{(1 2), (2 3), (1 3)\}$$. In $$S_n$$ the conjugacy class of $$\sigma$$ is all permutations whose cycle decomposition has the same shape (ie the lenghts of the cycles are the same).

Theorem (class equation): let g be a finite group, let $$g_1,...,g_k \in G\\Z(G)$$ such that if $$g_i$$ and $$g_j$$ are conjugated then i = j. If $$g \in G\\Z(G)$$ then there exists an i such that g and $$g_i$$ are conjugated. Then $$\vert G \vert = \vert Z(G) \cert + \sum[G:C_G(g_i)]$$

Proof: let $$O_g$$ denote the conjugacy class of g. Then $$G = \bigcup_{g \in G} O_g = \bigcup_{g \in G, \vert O_g \vert = 1} O_g \cup \bigcup_{g \in G, \vert O_g \vert > 1} O_g = \bigcup_i O_g_i$$ Hence $$\vert G \vert = \vert Z(G) \vert + \sum \vert O_g \vert = \vert G \vert = \vert Z(G) \vert + [G: S_G(g_i)]$$ where $$S_G(g_i)$$ is the stabilizer for conjugation action and equal to $$C_G(g_i)$$

Theorem: Let $$\vert G \vert = p^n, n \in \mathbb{Z}_{>0}$$. Then $$ Z(G) \neq \{1\}$$.

Proof: $$\vert G \vert = \vert Z(G) \vert + \sum [G: C_G(g_i)]$$ note that the last part is divisible by p. So $$0 = \vert Z(G) \vert + \sum 0$$ mod p so p divides $$\vert Z(G) \vert \geq 1. \vert Z^i(G) \vert > p > 1$$ and $$Z(G) \neq \{1\}$$.

Corollary: if $$\vert G \vert = p^2$$ then either $$g \cong \mathbb{Z}/p^2\mathbb{Z}$$ or $$G \cong (\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^2$$

Theorem (Cauchy's theorem): Let G ve a finite group and p prime dividing $$\vert G \vert$$ then there exists a $$g \in G$$ of order p.

Proof: let's prove the theorem when G is abelian. We proceed by generalized induction. Pick an element $$x \in G$$. If p divides $$\vert x \vert = pd$$ then $$x^d$$ is order p. If p does not divide $$\vert x \vert$$ then $$\vert G/<x> = \frac{\vert G \vert}{\vert x \vert}, \vert G/<x> \vert < \vert G \vert$$. By induction there exists $$y \in G$$ such that $$y<x>$$ is order p. Since $$y \not\in <x> and (y<x>)^p = <x>$$ then $$y^p \in <x>$$ and $$<y^p> < <y>, [<y> : <y^p>] = gcd(\vert y \vert , p) \neq 1$$ so p divides $$\vert y \vert$$. We are done by the cyclic group case. General case: (we also proceed by generalized induction). By the class equation $$\vert G \vert = \vert Z(G) \vert + \sum \vert [G: C_G(g_i)]$$. Assume p divides all $$[G: C_G(g_i)]$$ then p divides $$\vert Z(G) \vert$$ so we are done by the abelian case. Otherwise, i does not divide $$[G: C_G(g_i)]$$ for some i. $$\vert G \vert = [G: C_G(g_i)]\cdot \vert C_G(g_i) \vert$$ (p divides $$\vert G \vert$$ and $$\vert C_G(g_i)\vert$$) $$\vert C_G(g_i) \vert < \vert G \vert$$ so by induction we're done.
