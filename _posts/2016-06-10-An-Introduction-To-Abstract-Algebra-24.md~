Welcome to the 24th post on my abstract algebra series. Today I'll go over algebraic extensions.

Lemma: Let K be a field and $$(F_i)_{i \in I}$$ be a collection of subfields of K. Then $$\bigcap_{i \in I}F_i$$ is a subfield of K (proof is left as an exercise to the reader).

Generated field: let K be a field, $$A \subseteq K$$. The field generated by A is the smallest subfield of K that contains A, which if it exists, is exactly $$\bigcap_{F \leq K, A \subseteq F}F$$).

Notation: if $$K \vert F$$ is a field extension and $$\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n \in K$$, then $$F(\alpha_1, \alpha_2, ..., \alpha_n)$$ is the field generated by F and $$\alpha$$. If $$K = F(\alpha), \alpha \in K$$ then $$K \vert F$$ is simple and $$\alpha$$ is a primite element.

Proposition: let $$F \vert K$$ is a field extension, $$\alpha \in K$$, and $$P \in F[x]$$ irreducible with $$P(\alpha) = 0$$ then $$F[x]/(p) \cong F(\alpha) \leq K$$, $$x \mod p \mapsto \alpha$$.

Proof: let $$\phi : F[x] \rightarrow F(\alpha)$$ be a ring homomorphism defined by $$P \mapsto P(\alpha)$$. ker$$(\phi): P \in ker(\phi) \rightarrow (P) \in ker(\phi)$$. since P is irreducible and F[x] is a PID, (P) is maximal, hence $$ker(\phi) = (P)$$ or $$F(\alpha)$$. Note that $$ker(\phi) \neq F(\alpha)$$ because $$\phi(1x^0) \neq 0$$ so $$ker(\phi) = (P)$$. By the first isomorphism theorem $$F[x]/(p) \cong Im(\phi) \leq F(\alpha)$$, where $$Im(\phi) = F(\alpha)$$.

Corollary: Let F, K, P and $$\alpha$$ be defined as above and deg(P) = n, then $$F(\alpha) = \{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a_i\alpha^i : a_i \in F \}$$ and $$[F(\alpha): F] = n$$.

let $$K \vert F$$ be a field extension. $$\alpha in K$$ is algebraic if there is a $$P \in F[x]$$ such that $$P(\alpha) = 0.$$ If $$\alpha \in K$$ is not algebraic it is transendental. $$K \vert F$$ is algebraic if every $$\alpha \in K$$ is algebraic over F.

A polynomial is said to me monic if the leading coefficient is 1.

Proposition: Let $$K \vert F$$ be a field extesion, $$\alpha \in K$$ algebraic. Then there exists $$M_{\alpha, F} \in F[x]$$ irreducible monic such that $$M_{\alpha, F}(\alpha) = 0.$$ Also, $$\{P \in F[x]: P(\alpha) = 0\} = (M_{\alpha, F})$$.

Proof: $$I(\alpha) = \{P \in F[x] : P(\alpha) = 0 \}$$, $$I(\alpha) = ker(ev_{\alpha} \vert F[x])$$ so $$I(\alpha) \subseteq F[x]$$ is an ideal. Since $$F[x]$$ is a PID, $$I(\alpha) = (Q)$$ for some $$Q \in F[x]$$. $$Q = \sum_{i=0}^n a_iX^i$$ and $$M_{\alpha, F} = a^{-1}_nQ$$ so $$I(\alpha) = (M_{\alpha, F})$$ because Q and $$M_{\alpha, F}$$ are associated. So $$M_{\alpha, F}(K) = 0$$. By the first isomorphism theorem $$F[x]/I(\alpha) \cong Im(ev_{\alpha} \vert F[x]) \leq K$$. Since $$Im(ev_{\alpha} \vert F[x])$$ is integral, $$I(\alpha)$$ is prime, therefore Q is irreducible and $$M_{\alpha, F}$$ is irreducible.

Corollary: let $$L \vert K \vert F$$ be field extensions and $$\alpha \in L$$ be algebraic over F, then $$M_{\alpha, K} \vert M_{\alpha, F}$$ in $$K[x]$$.

Proof: $$\alpha$$ is a root of $$M_{\alpha, F}$$ so $$M_{\alpha, F} \in (M_{\alpha, k}) \leq K[x]$$.

$$M_{\alpha, F}$$ is a minimal polynomial of $$\alpha$$ over F.

Remark: $$F[x]/(M_{\alpha, F}) \cong F(\alpha)$$ so $$[F(\alpha): F] = deg M_{\alpha, F} = deg(\alpha/F)$$

Examples: $$i/\mathbb{R}$$ has minimal polynomial $$x^2+1$$ (deg 2), $$\sqrt{2}/\mathbb{Q}$$ has minimal polynomial $$x^2-2$$ (deg 2), $$\sqrt(2)/\mathbb{R}$$ has minimal polynomial $$x - \sqrt(2)$$ (deg 1), j/Q has minimal polynomial $$x^2+x+1$$ (deg 2)

Proposition: $$\alpha$$ is algebraic over F if and only if $$[F(\alpha): F]$$ is finite.

Proof: the forward direction is proved above: $$[F(\alpha):F] = deg(M_{\alpha, F})$$ which is finite. Conversely, let $$n = [F(\alpha):F]$$. $$1, \alpha, \alpha^2, ..., \alpha^n$$ are not linearly independent over F, therefore there exists $$\lambda_i \in F$$ not all 0 such that $$\sum \lambda_i \alpha^i = 0$$, hence $$P = \sum \lambda_i \alpha^i$$ so $$P(\alpha) = 0$$.

Corollary: let $$K \vert F$$ be a field extension and $$\alpha \in K$$ algebraic. Then $$F(\alpha) \vert F$$ is algebraic.

Proof: let $$\beta \in F(\alpha)$$, then $$F \leq F(\beta) \leq F(\alpha)$$ so $$[F(\alpha):F] \geq [F(\beta):F] \leq \infty$$ so $$\beta$$ is algebraic over F.

This post is the conclusion to the material I prepared for the introduction to abstract algebra series, as of now. Stay tuned for more posts in the future!
