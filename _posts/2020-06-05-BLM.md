This list is by no means comprehensive, but I thought it would be a good idea to make a list of books that people could use as educational resources, that are actually written by people of colour. There's plenty of books out there that fit into that category, but sadly I've not seen a lot of lists that specifically highlight only black voices. I've included nonfiction books talking about racism in the US, Britain, and Australia. 

If you'd rather see the list as a goodreads shelf, [here you go!](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/64948283-jamie-cayley?shelf=blm) But note that the goodreads list is not sorted by genre.
