Welcome to the 23rd post on my abstract algebra series. Today I'll go over basic properties of fields.

Let R be a ring. We have a map $$c : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow R$$ defined as $$n_{> 0 } \mapsto n\times 1_R, n_{< 0} \mapsto n \times (-1_R)$$. c is a ring homomorphism and ker(c) = n for some $$n \in \mathbb{Z}_{\geq 0}$$. n is called the characteristic of R.

Proposition: let F be a field. Then char(F) is prime or 0.

Proof: let $$c : \mathbb{Z} \rightarrow Im(c) \leq F$$. By the first isomorphism theorem $$\mathbb{Z}/(n) \cong Im(c) \leq F$$ so (n) is a prime ideal therefore n = 0 or $$n >0$$. Since $$\mathbb{Z}$$ is a UFD, n is prime (if $$n > 0$$) or n = 0.

The prime subfield of a field F is the subfield of G generated by the multiplicative identity $$1_F$$ of F. It is isomorphic to $$\mathbb{Q}$$ if char(F) = 0 or $$\mathbb{F}_p = \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}$$ if char(F) = p.

If $$F \leq K$$ is a subring of K *where F and K are fields) we say that K is a field extension of F and denote it $$K \vert F$$.

Let F be a field. A F vector space is a set V with 2 operations: $$+ : V^2 \rightarrow V$$, $$\cdot : F \rightarrow V$$ that satisfies the following axioms:
1) $$(V, +)$$ is an abelian group
2) for all $$\lambda, \mu \in F$$ and $$x, y \in V, (\lambda + \mu) \cdot x =$$ $$\lambda \cdot x + \mu \cdot x$$ $$\lambda \cdot (x+y) = \lambda \cdot x + \mu \cdot y$$ $$(\lambda \mu) \cdot x = \lambda \cdot (\mu \cdot x)$$, $$1_f \cdot x = x$$

Lemma: if $$K \vert F$$ is a field extension then $$(K, +, \cdot)$$ is an F vector space.

dim(K) is the degree of the extension $$K \vert F$$ and is denoted $$[K :F]$$ (note that although this notation is the same notation we use for group indexes, it is not the index).

Theorem: ket F be a field, $$P \in F[x]$$ an irreducible polynomial There exists a field extension $$K \vert F$$ such that P has a root in K.

Stay tuned for a post on algebraic extensions next!
